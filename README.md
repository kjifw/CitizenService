# Citizen Service Mobile App

The main goal of the app is to create and share issues that consern not only you but other citizens as well. You can add title, city, provide a short description of the issue and images of the issue you want to submit (you can be anonymous if you want). There is also a voting system implemented - if you feel an issue is valid you can support it or if you think it is not you can report it as incorrect. After a certain amount of reports the issue is removed from the database. You can also view detailed information about each issue.
